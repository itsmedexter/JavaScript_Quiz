# JavaScript Quiz

![Redone](./Assets/coding_quiz.gif)

In this assignment, here is a code quiz with multiple-choice questions built in Javascript, HTML, CSS. 

## Little refresher

Whats strange, I saw some of the old code in this file. I wonder why I didn't finish it before? It was all there, I just had to clean it up and make sure the HTML classes were changed for the Javascript.
